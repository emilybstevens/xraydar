                        Biology from St. Mary's University in San Antonio, Texas. She is passionate about exploring ways to improve healthcare communications 
                        and technology to better accomodate patient needs. </br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this project, Emily handled the creation of the entire dashboard website, as well as the interactive JS dash. Emily also handled 
                        the CSV-to-JSON conversions for the data required by the JS dash. Lastly, she was responsible for the creation of all creative assets, 
                        including the "X-Raydar" branding and logo.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klaudia Schnittker is a Texas Certified Public Accountant with a BBA in Accounting and Financial Bank Management and an MBA with Accounting 
                        Concentration from the University of Texas at El Paso. Klaudia likes to deep dive into data to identify relationships, discrepancies 
                        and areas for improvements. </br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Klaudia created the Amazon Web Services connection to upload the main x-ray data source file and mortality 
                        classification file into PGAdmin. In PGAdmin she split the multiple label x-ray images in order to rank and classify the triage level 
                        for each x-ray image based on the mortality classification table. Finally, she mapped the PGAdmin to jupyter notebook to be used in the 
                        machine learning model.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chris is a multifaceted individual whose passions have led him into a variety of new and challenging experiences. 
                        At West Chester University of Pennsylvania, his concise analytical thinking earned him his Bachelor’s degree in American History. 
                        Following graduation, Chris embarked on a cross-country journey to California where he was able to utilize his hands-on approach, 
                        quite literally, in construction. </br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This period allowed Chris to hone his problem-solving and communication skills in real-world scenarios, 
                        often under pressure and strict timelines. In his free time, Chris loves to explore theme parks. The variety of roller coasters spanning Southern 
                        California not only entice his thrill-seeking side, but also pique his curiosity of their mechanisms and comparative statistics. These experiences 
                        and interests gave him a unique perspective throughout this bootcamp, as well as during this final project. </br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project’s Tableau Visualizations represent a culmination of these passions and experiences, telling an easily 
                        understandable story through charts with visible and actionable results.
